# Electron-Sample

## Description

This repository contains a project that shows how you can combine an Electron interface with a Console backend written in C# and Python.

I didn't provide other scripting and programming languages, but feel free to add them.

## Licensing

I didn't set a license. That means that you are free to use this project completely free, also with commercial purposes and you don't have to share any source code when you distribute this app.

Although, what I have created is not very useful.

## How to use it?

### Install neede software.

First of all, you need some stuff installed:

* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) includig the Node.JS runtime and the NPM package manager. Use their installation instructions to install this.

```

The command indicates that you want to install Electron globally, so you can use it in every project.
